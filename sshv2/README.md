## About

Setting up an SSH server allows access to your Hass.io folders with any SSH
client. It also includes a command-line tool to access the Hass.io API.

Try it out using:

```bash
hassio help
```

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is straightforward and easy to do.

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Hass.io** -> **Add-on Store**.
2. Find the "SSH server" add-on and click it.
3. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

## How to use

To use this add-on, you must have a private/public key to log in.
To generate them, follow the [instructions for Windows][keygen-windows]
and [these for other platforms][keygen]. It is possible to set a password for
login since version 2.0 but for high security use private/public keys.

You can not run both variants at the same time. Enabling login via keys, will
simply disable password login.

1. Add a ssh key to  `authorized_keys` or set a `password` in the add-on configuration.
2. Start the add-on.
3. Connect to your device using your preferred SSH client and use `root` as 
   the username.

After logging in, you will find yourself in this add-onâ€™s container.
The Home Assistant configuration directory is mounted on the path `/config`.

## Configuration

Add-on configuration:

```json
{
  "authorized_keys": [
    "ssh-rsa AKDJD3839...== my-key"
  ],
  "password": ""
}
```

### Option: `authorized_keys`

Your **public keys** for the authorized key file. You can authorize multiple
keys by adding multiple public keys to the list.

### Option: `password`

Set a password for login. **We do NOT recommend this variant**.

## Known issues and limitations

- This add-on will not enable you to install packages or do anything as root.
  This is not working with Hass.io.
